# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
A brief overview with examples of some Machine Learning Algorithms. This repository contains the contents of a course conducted by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves.

This repository is a continuly added to, completing various components of the Udemy course, Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science. 

It has proven to be a very useful resource in allowing me to progress towards working on projects of my own. I have attempted to apply most of my learnings from this course to Kaggle projects in the fields of my interests. 
Please feel free to have a look at my Kaggle projects repository to gain further insight into my application of this knowledge.
